Distributed GCD Application
---------------------------

each node owns a value

computes common gcd of all values while only 
communicating with direct neighbours

------------------------------------------------------------
how to start gcd application with given number of nodes

usage: 
1) use gcd-starter to start a number of instances
   of the python gcd-node.py script
2) send a system application message to one of the
   nodes, try something like

   echo "SYST APPL" | nc localhost 50001

   or use 
   telnet localhost 50001 
   instead
